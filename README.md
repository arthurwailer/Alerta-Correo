When an IPv4 network device does not have ping or telnet, it sends an email to the recipients,
when you do not have ping for 1 minute send an email with the warning, then if you do not have ping or telnet for 10 min send in second mail and then the loop ends. to resend the email you have to reestablish your connection.
